About me

ðŸ‘‹ Hello, My name is Khanh Nguyen with a MBA from Audencia Business School and a Google Data Analytics Certificate. I believe that data is a valuable resource for the world, to have more insights and ideas to improve and develop this world. I love being a part of it so I can dig deeper and understand more about the meaning behind the data.

ðŸ‘€ I have data preparation, manipulation, wrangling, and visualization experience using Python, SQL, R, Tableau, and Microsoft Excel. Iâ€™m currently applying to jobs in Data Science, Data Analytics, and Business Intelligence Analyst. If you are looking for a hardworking, responsible, positive team member, look no further!
